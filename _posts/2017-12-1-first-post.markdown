<h2>Let's blog</h2>

Hello, I'm MagpieDuck (aka "Canardou" in french or "hit"). My real name is Olivier Hachette.

I'm a french engineer in computer science and computer graphics, javascript enthusiast, game master in various role playing game and I make a lot of drawing. This website contains some finished or unfinished projects around these topics.

I try to make most of the content of my website accessible in english, but some of the pages are still only in french waiting to be translated.

See you around.
